    Calculate the steps needed to reach all final nodes '**Z' from the starting nodes '**A'.
    This uses a trick that I borrowed from the Reddit forum: getting the lowest common multiple (LCM) of the number of
    steps for every path.
    I initially didn't understand why the search is cyclic, i.e.: if you find '**Z' in n steps and you go on moving
    along the network following directions you would reach another '**Z' in n steps, and over and over again.
    However, the pattern of the LCM becomes visible if you pay attention to the explanation and the bold parts:
        Step 0: You are at 11A and 22A.
        Step 1: You choose all of the left paths, leading you to 11B and 22B.
        Step 2: You choose all of the right paths, leading you to 11Z and 22C.
        Step 3: You choose all of the left paths, leading you to 11B and 22Z.
        Step 4: You choose all of the right paths, leading you to 11Z and 22B.
        Step 5: You choose all of the left paths, leading you to 11B and 22C.
        Step 6: You choose all of the right paths, leading you to 11Z and 22Z.
